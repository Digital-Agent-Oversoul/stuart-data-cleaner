# Stuart Data Cleaning System - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Overview**

### **Project Name**
Stuart Data Cleaning System

### **Project Description**
A unified data cleaning system with two primary functions: "Broadly Survey" for daily, smaller, location-segmented outputs for customer surveys, and "Contact Export" for monthly/quarterly, larger, aggregated outputs for detailed contact lists. Both functions share the same LLM-based cleaning logic with an interactive learning framework.

### **Project Goals**
1. **Unify Data Cleaning Logic**: Create a shared core engine for both processes
2. **Implement Interactive Learning**: Human-in-the-loop system for edge case handling
3. **Ensure Process Independence**: Complete isolation between Survey and Contact Export processes
4. **Build Modern Interface**: Archon-style UI/UX for initial rollout and maintenance
5. **Prepare for Automation**: Headless operation ready for future workflow integration

## ðŸŽ¯ **Functional Requirements**

### **Core Data Processing Engine**
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini) as primary, Ollama as fallback
- **Unified Cleaning Logic**: Shared processing for both Survey and Contact Export
- **Interactive Learning**: Detect uncertainty, prompt user guidance, learn from decisions
- **Budget Monitoring**: Track OpenAI costs, prevent runaway expenses
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback systems with user confirmation

### **Broadly Survey Process**
- **Input**: Raw data files (Excel format)
- **Processing**: Daily execution on smaller datasets
- **Output**: Location-segmented files (Dublin/Milpitas)
- **Use Case**: Customer survey distribution
- **Frequency**: Daily operations

### **Contact Export Process**
- **Input**: Raw data files (Excel format)
- **Processing**: Monthly/quarterly execution on larger datasets
- **Output**: Single aggregated file with comprehensive contact information
- **Use Case**: Detailed customer contact lists
- **Frequency**: Less frequent, larger batches

### **Interactive Learning Framework**
- **Uncertainty Detection**: Identify when LLM needs guidance
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Prompt user for decision on edge cases
- **Pattern Learning**: Build knowledge base from user decisions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Learn when to be confident vs. when to ask
- **Prompt Evolution**: Improve prompts based on user feedback

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Requirements**

### **Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Independent processes with shared core engine
- **Multi-tier LLM**: OpenAI â†’ Ollama â†’ Rule-based fallback
- **Process Isolation**: Failure in one process doesn't affect the other
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variables + JSON config files

### **Data Processing**
- **Input Format**: Excel files (.xlsx) with specific sheet structure
- **Output Formats**: Excel files with professional formatting
- **Data Validation**: Fixed data structure, no adaptive parsing needed
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large datasets efficiently

### **Interface Requirements**
- **Initial Rollout**: Localhost web interface or self-contained app
- **Archon-Style UX**: Modern, intuitive interface mimicking Archon design
- **Process Selection**: Clear choice between Survey vs Contact Export
- **Real-time Progress**: Live processing visualization
- **File Management**: Drag/drop, file browsing, content viewing

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics**

### **Data Quality**
- **Name Extraction Accuracy**: >95% for person names vs business names
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Handle 90%+ of complex name scenarios
- **Processing Reliability**: <1% failure rate for both processes

### **Performance**
- **Processing Speed**: Survey process <5 minutes for daily datasets
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Contact Export process <30 minutes for quarterly datasets
- **LLM Response Time**: <10 seconds per name parsing request

### **User Experience**
- **Learning Efficiency**: System improves with each user interaction
- **Interface Usability**: <2 minutes to complete typical workflow
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling with clear user guidance

## ðŸš§ **Constraints & Assumptions**

### **Technical Constraints**
- **Fixed Data Structure**: Raw data format is immutable
- **Budget Limitations**: OpenAI API costs must be controlled
- **Local Operation**: Initial deployment on local infrastructure
- **Excel Compatibility**: Input/output must maintain Excel format

### **Business Constraints**
- **Process Independence**: Survey and Contact Export must operate separately
- **Data Security**: Sensitive customer information handling
- **Compliance**: Maintain data integrity and audit trails
- **Scalability**: Prepare for future automation and larger datasets

### **Assumptions**
- **User Expertise**: Operators have domain knowledge for edge case decisions
- **Data Consistency**: Raw data follows established patterns
- **LLM Availability**: OpenAI API and Ollama fallback are accessible
- **Interface Access**: Users have access to web interface or application

## ðŸ”„ **User Stories**

### **Primary Users**
1. **Data Operators**: Daily execution of Survey process
2. **Data Analysts**: Monthly/quarterly Contact Export processing
3. **System Administrators**: Configuration and maintenance
4. **Future Automation**: Headless operation for workflow integration

### **User Story Examples**
- **As a Data Operator**, I want to quickly process daily survey data so that customer surveys can be sent promptly
- **As a Data Analyst**, I want to generate comprehensive contact lists so that detailed customer analysis can be performed
- **As a System Administrator**, I want to monitor LLM performance so that I can optimize costs and quality
- **As an Automation System**, I want to process data without human intervention so that workflows can run automatically

## ðŸ“ˆ **Future Considerations**

### **Automation Readiness**
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful interfaces for headless operation
- **Scheduling**: Automated execution based on business rules
- **Integration**: Hooks for workflow management systems
- **Monitoring**: Automated quality assessment and alerting

### **Scalability**
- **Cloud Deployment**: Move from localhost to hosted solution
- **Multi-tenant**: Support multiple organizations
- **Performance Optimization**: Handle larger datasets efficiently
- **Advanced Analytics**: Data quality metrics and reporting
