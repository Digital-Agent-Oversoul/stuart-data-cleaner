# Stuart Project - Automatic Session Initialization

## Overview

This project now includes automatic session initialization that ensures every new session:
1. **Automatically connects to Archon MCP server**
2. **Loads all BMad method rules and configuration**
3. **Retrieves current project status and task information**
4. **Presents comprehensive project overview to the user**

## How It Works

### Automatic Rule Loading

The `.cursor/rules/session-init.mdc` rule automatically activates when the workspace is loaded, ensuring:

- **Archon MCP Connection**: Establishes connection to the Archon server
- **BMad Method Loading**: Loads all BMad rules and project configuration
- **Status Retrieval**: Gets current project status, active tasks, and progress
- **User Presentation**: Shows comprehensive project overview and next steps

### No Scripts Required

Everything works through:
- **MCP Tools**: Built-in Model Context Protocol tools for Archon connection
- **BMad Rules**: Automatic loading of all BMad methodology rules
- **Workspace Configuration**: VS Code workspace settings that trigger initialization

### Session Continuity

Each session automatically:
- Maintains context from previous sessions
- Shows current project progress
- Identifies next recommended actions
- Ensures no duplicate work or conflicting actions

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.cursor/rules/session-init.mdc` - Session initialization rule
- `Stuart.code-workspace` - VS Code workspace configuration
- `.bmad-core/session-manager.md` - BMad session management documentation

### Modified Files
- `.cursor/mcp.json` - Enhanced MCP configuration with additional Archon tools
- `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` - Added session manager configuration

## What Happens at Session Start

1. **Workspace Loads**: VS Code/Cursor loads the workspace
2. **Rules Activate**: Session initialization rule automatically activates
3. **Archon Connection**: MCP tools connect to Archon server
4. **Status Retrieval**: Current project status and tasks are retrieved
5. **BMad Loading**: All BMad rules and configuration are loaded
6. **Status Report**: Comprehensive project overview is presented
7. **User Direction**: System waits for user input on next actions

## Expected Session Start Output

```
ðŸ”— **Stuart Project Session Initialized**

ðŸ“Š **Current Project Status:**
- Phase: Development (Epic 2 in progress)
- Active Tasks: 3 tasks in "doing" status
- Next Story: "Implement data validation engine" (Ready for Dev)

ðŸ¤– **Available BMad Agents:**
1. @sm - Create next story
2. @dev - Implement current story  
3. @qa - Review completed work
4. @po - Validate story readiness
5. @pm - Update requirements

 **Recommended Next Actions:**
- Continue with current story implementation
- Create next story if current is complete
- Review any completed work

ðŸ’¬ **What would you like to accomplish in this session?**
```

## Benefits

### Automatic
- No manual initialization required
- Consistent session setup every time
- No forgotten steps or missed connections

### Comprehensive
- Full project status at a glance
- All BMad agents immediately available
- Clear next steps and recommendations

### Compliant
- Follows BMad methodology automatically
- Maintains proper development workflow
- Ensures task status tracking through Archon

## Troubleshooting

### If Archon Connection Fails
- Check if Archon server is running on port 8051
- Verify Docker containers are active
- Check MCP configuration in `.cursor/mcp.json`

### If BMad Rules Don't Load
- Verify `.cursor/rules/` folder structure
- Check workspace configuration in `Stuart.code-workspace`
- Ensure all rule files have correct YAML frontmatter

### If Session Doesn't Initialize
- Restart VS Code/Cursor
- Check workspace file is properly loaded
- Verify rule files are in correct locations

## Next Steps

After session initialization:
1. **Review the presented project status**
2. **Choose your next action** (continue development, create story, etc.)
3. **Use appropriate BMad agents** for your chosen task
4. **Follow the established workflow** for your selected action

The system is now fully automated and will provide this initialization experience every time you open the Stuart project workspace.
